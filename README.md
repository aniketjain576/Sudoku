# Sudoku #
This code can solve any Sudoku puzzle you give it. (provided it is solvable)  
It can also generate Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties for you!

## Input ##
The input.txt file is where you type the sudoku puzzle you want solved.  
The format of the input is as follows:  
  * Enter each number separated by a space and start a new line after 9 digits.  
  * Enter 0 in place of blank spaces in the sudoku puzzle you want solved.  
  * Refer to input.txt for examples!  
  
A sudoku game consists of a 9x9 board and the code only reads the first 9 lines of input.txt.  
## Running the Code ##
Board.cpp should not be included in the build.  
The code will ask you whether you want to solve or generate a puzzle. Simply follow along!  
Remember to type the puzzle you want solved in input.txt before running main.cpp.
